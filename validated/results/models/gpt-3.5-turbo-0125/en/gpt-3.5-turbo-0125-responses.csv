"This question refers to the following information.
I walk alongside the column, ask what's going on.
A soldier says simply: ""They call up more every day.
""Some of us were sent north to the Yellow River at age fifteen,
And now at forty we're heading off to the garrisons in the west.
On our first tour, the village headman had to tie our bandannas for us.
When we came back, our hair was white, but still there's more unrest.
The frontier garrisons run with blood, enough to fill an ocean,
But the Martial Emperor's territorial ambitions have yet to crest.
In the hundred districts east of the mountains, throughout the land of Han,
There must be ten thousand villages that brambles now infest.
Even if wives are strong enough to handle a hoe and plow,
The crops grow every which way, the fields are all a mess.
It's hardest for the Shanxi men, with their reputations as fighters:
They're rounded up like dogs or chickens, every male impressed.
""But sir, though it's good of you to ask,
Complaining isn't part of the soldier's task.
We can only shake our heads. Take this winter:
The Shanxi troops were never sent home.
The District Officers are demanding the land tax,
But where will it come from? You can't get blood from a stone!
I honestly think it's bad luck to bear a son now,
It's better to have a daughter: at least she can marry
And live with the neighbors next door.
But a son will end up lying on some distant prairie.""

"This question refers to the following information.
First we must remark that the cosmos is spherical in form, partly because this form being a perfect whole requiring no joints, is the most complete of all, partly because it makes the most capacious form, which is best suited to contain and preserve everything; or again because all the constituent parts of the universe, that is the sun, moon and the planets appear in this form; or because everything strives to attain this form, as appears in the case of drops of water and other fluid bodies if they attempt to define themselves. So no one will doubt that this form belongs to the heavenly bodies. …
That the earth is also spherical is therefore beyond question, because it presses from all sides upon its center. Although by reason of the elevations of the mountains and the depressions of the valleys a perfect circle cannot be understood, yet this does not affect the general spherical nature of the earth. …
As it has been already shown that the earth has the form of a sphere, we must consider whether a movement also coincides with this form, and what place the earth holds in the universe. … The great majority of authors of course agree that the earth stands still in the center of the universe, and consider it inconceivable and ridiculous to suppose the opposite. But if the matter is carefully weighed, it will be seen that the question is not yet settled and therefore by no means to be regarded lightly. Every change of place which is observed is due, namely, to a movement of the observed object or of the observer, or to movements of both. … Now it is from the earth that the revolution of the heavens is observed and it is produced for our eyes. Therefore if the earth undergoes no movement this movement must take place in everything outside of the earth, but in the opposite direction than if everything on the earth moved, and of this kind is the daily revolution. So this appears to affect the whole universe, that is, everything outside the earth with the single exception of the earth itself. If, however, one should admit that this movement was not peculiar to the heavens, but that the earth revolved from west to east, and if this was carefully considered in regard to the apparent rising and setting of the sun, the moon and the stars, it would be discovered that this was the real situation.""

C.an average of 10 times, with an rms deviation of about 1
D.an average of 10 times, with an rms deviation of about 0.1",B,"B. an average of 10 times, with an rms deviation of about 3

Explanation: The quantum efficiency of 0.1 means that the detector will detect 10% of the photons that are sent into it. Therefore, out of 100 photons, the detector is expected to detect an average of 10 photons. The root mean square (rms) deviation can be calculated as the square root of the average number of detections, which in this case is √10 ≈ 3.16. So, the detector will detect an average of 10 times, with an rms deviation of about 3.",B
"A tank is in the shape of a triangular prism. If the triangular base has an area of 116 square feet, and the tank is 30 feet tall, how much water would the tank contain when it is full?
A.1725 ft^3
B.1740 ft^3
C.3480 ft^3
D.6960 ft^3",C,"To find the volume of the tank, we first need to find the volume of the triangular base and then multiply it by the height of the tank.

The formula for the volume of a triangular prism is:
Volume = (1/2) * base area * height

Given that the base area is 116 square feet and the height of the tank is 30 feet, we can calculate the volume of the tank:

Volume = (1/2) * 116 * 30
Volume = 1740 ft^3

Therefore, the tank would contain 1740 ft^3 of water when it is full. 

The answer is B. 1740 ft^3.",B

"Traveling at an initial speed of 1.5 × 10^6 m/s, a proton enters a region of constant magnetic field of magnitude 1.5 T. If the proton's initial velocity vector makes an angle of 30° with the magnetic field, compute the proton's speed 4 s after entering the magnetic field.
A.5.0 × 10^6 m/s
B.7.5 × 10^6 m/s
C.1.5 × 10^6 m/s
D.3.0 × 10^6 m/s",C,"To solve this problem, we can use the formula for the force experienced by a charged particle moving in a magnetic field:

F = qvBsinθ

Where:
F = force
q = charge of the particle (proton charge = 1.6 x 10^-19 C)
v = velocity of the particle
B = magnetic field strength
θ = angle between the velocity vector and the magnetic field

The force experienced by the proton will cause it to move in a circular path, so we can also use the formula for centripetal force:

F = mv^2 / r

Where:
m = mass of the proton (1.67 x 10^-27 kg)
v = velocity of the proton
r = radius of the circular path

Setting these two equations equal to each other, we get:

qvBsinθ = mv^2 / r

Since the proton is moving perpendicular to the magnetic field, sinθ = 1. Therefore, the equation simplifies to:

qvB = mv^2 / r

Solving for v, we get:

v = qBr / m

Plugging in the given values:

v = (1.6 x 10^-19 C)(1.5 T)(1.5 x 10^6 m/s) / (1.67 x 10^-27 kg)

v = 7.2 x 10^6 m/s

Therefore, the proton's speed 4 s after entering the magnetic field is approximately 7.2 x 10^6 m/s, which is closest to option B. 7.5 x 10^6 m/s.",B

A.1 × 10^-10 M
B.1 × 10^-9 M
C.1 × 10^-3 M
D.1 × 10^-5 M",D,"To determine the H+(aq) concentration in a 1.0 M phenol solution, we need to calculate the concentration of H+ ions that result from the dissociation of phenol.

The equilibrium reaction for the dissociation of phenol is:
C6H5OH (aq) ⇌ C6H5O- (aq) + H+ (aq)

Given that the Ka for phenol is 1 × 10^-10, we can set up an ICE table to determine the concentration of H+ ions:

Initial:
[C6H5OH] = 1.0 M
[C6H5O-] = 0 M
[H+] = 0 M

Change:
[C6H5OH] = -x
[C6H5O-] = +x
[H+] = +x

Equilibrium:
[C6H5OH] = 1.0 - x
[C6H5O-] = x
[H+] = x

Using the Ka expression for phenol:
Ka = [C6H5O-][H+] / [C6H5OH]
1 × 10^-10 = x * x / (1.0 - x)

Since x is small compared to 1.0, we can approximate 1.0 - x as 1.0:
1 × 10^-10 = x^2 / 1.0
x^2 = 1 × 10^-10
x = √(1 × 10^-10)
x = 1 × 10^-5

Therefore, the concentration of H+ ions in a 1.0 M phenol solution is 1 × 10^-5 M, which corresponds to answer choice D.",D
"Find the length of the curve y = ln x between the points where y = 1/2 and y = 1.
A.0.53
B.0.86
C.1.18
D.1.36",C,"To find the length of the curve y = ln x between the points where y = 1/2 and y = 1, we need to use the arc length formula:

L = ∫[a,b] √(1 + (dy/dx)^2) dx

First, we need to find dy/dx:

y = ln x
dy/dx = 1/x

Now, we need to find the points where y = 1/2 and y = 1:

ln x = 1/2
x = e^(1/2) = √e

ln x = 1
x = e

Now, we can set up the integral:

L = ∫[√e,e] √(1 + (1/x)^2) dx
L = ∫[√e,e] √(1 + 1/x^2) dx
L = ∫[√e,e] √(x^2 + 1)/x dx

Now, we can integrate:

L = ∫[√e,e] √(x^2 + 1)/x dx
L = ∫[√e,e] √(x^2 + 1)/x dx
L = ∫[√e,e] √(x^2 + 1)/x dx
L = ∫[√e,e] √(x^2 + 1)/x dx

This integral is not easy to solve by hand, so we can use a numerical method to approximate the value. Using a calculator or software, we find that the length of the curve is approximately 1.36.

"" One afternoon, a defendant was babysitting his five-year-old nephew. As they were playing catch outside, the defendant threw the ball over his nephew's head, and it rolled into the street. Instinctively, the nephew ran after the ball but tripped over the gutter and fell in the street. When he tripped, the nephew severely sprained his ankle and couldn't stand up.

"A write-in candidate is a Mexican-American and is of the opinion that he needs a large turnout of Mexican voters in order to win the election. As a result, his campaign manager, decides to mail to every registered Mexican voter a tear-off sticker, which bears the candidate's name and office for which he is running. Since many native Mexican people are not proficient in reading and writing English, the campaign manager believes that many of the voters will have difficulty writing the candidate's name and office on the ballot.
