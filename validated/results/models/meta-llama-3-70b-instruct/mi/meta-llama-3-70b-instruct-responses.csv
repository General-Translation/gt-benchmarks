tauākī 2: (ab)^n = a^nb^n

A.te tapawhā tuatahi e tuwhera ana
B.he ānau kati
C.he hihi i te tapawhā tuatahi e tuwhera ana
D.he ira kotahi",a,"it looks like you're working on a math problem in māori!

the correct answer is a. te tapawhā tuatahi e tuwhera ana.

here's the explanation:

the given equation is x^(log y) = y^log x.

to solve for x, we can start by taking the logarithm of both sides with base x:

log x (x^(log y)) = log x (y^log x)

using the property of logarithms, we get:

(log y) \* log x (x) = (log x) \* log x (y)

since log x (x) = 1, we are left with:

log y = (log x)^2

now, exponentiating both sides with base e (or any other base), we get:

y = e^(log x)^2

this is the first derivative of the function, which is the rate of change of the function with respect to x. therefore, the correct answer is a. te tapawhā tuatahi e tuwhera ana, which translates to ""the first derivative is open"".",true

* ""he tino tāwari"" means ""a discount is given""
* ""te utu o te tono"" means ""on the price of the order""

so, the whole sentence ""he tino tāwari te utu o te tono"" means ""a discount is given on the price of the order"".

A.1725 ft^3
B.1740 ft^3
C.3480 ft^3
D.6960 ft^3",c,"a math problem in māori!

let's break it down:

* ""kai roto te kura i te āhua o te porotoru"" means the cylinder is inside a sphere.
* ""mēnā he rohe tapawhā 116 waewae tapawhā tō te pūtake tapatoru"" means if the radius of the sphere is 116 feet.
* ""ā, e 30 waewae te roa o te kura"" means and the height of the cylinder is 30 feet.
* ""e hia te nui o te wai e mau ana i te kura ina kī?"" means what is the volume of water that can be held by the cylinder?

to find the volume of the cylinder, we need to find its radius. since the cylinder is inside a sphere with a radius of 116 feet, the radius of the cylinder will be equal to the radius of the sphere.

the formula for the volume of a cylinder is v = πr²h, where r is the radius and h is the height.

first, let's find the radius of the cylinder: r = 116 feet

now, plug in the values: v = π(116)²(30)

v ≈ 3480 ft³

let's break it down:

we need to find the area under the curve y = ln(x) between the points where y = 1/2 and y = 1.

first, let's find the x-values corresponding to these y-values:

y = 1/2 => ln(x) = 1/2 => x = e^(1/2) ≈ 1.65
y = 1 => ln(x) = 1 => x = e^1 ≈ 2.72

now, we can integrate y = ln(x) with respect to x from x ≈ 1.65 to x ≈ 2.72:

∫[ln(x) dx] from 1.65 to 2.72
= [x ln(x) - x] from 1.65 to 2.72

B.1 × 10^-9 M
C.1 × 10^-3 M
D.1 × 10^-5 M",d,"a chemistry question!

let's break it down step by step:

we have a 1.0 m solution of phenol (c6h5oh) and we want to find the concentration of h+ ions (hydronium ions) in this solution.

the ka (acid dissociation constant) for phenol is given as 1 × 10^-10.

the equilibrium reaction is:

c6h5oh + h2o ⇌ c6h5o- + h3o+

the ka expression is:

ka = [c6h5o-][h3o+] / [c6h5oh]

we are given [c6h5oh] = 1.0 m, and we want to find [h3o+] (which is equivalent to [h+]).

rearranging the ka expression to solve for [h3o+], we get:

[h3o+] = ka × [c6h5oh] / [c6h5o-]

since the concentration of phenol is much higher than the concentration of its conjugate base (c6h5o-), we can assume that [c6h5o-] ≈ x, where x is the concentration of h3o+ (or h+) we're trying to find.

so, the equation becomes:

x = ka × 1.0 m / x

solving for x, we get:

x^2 = ka × 1.0 m
x^2 = 1 × 10^-10 × 1.0 m
x^2 = 1 × 10^-10 m^2
x = √(1 × 10^-10 m^2)
x ≈ 1 × 10^-5 m

* ""i roto i tētahi ara rangatū"" means ""in a certain direction""
* ""mēnā ko te rama kotahi ko te 2 a"" means ""if there's a single lamp with 2 amps""
* ""ko te mea o nāianei i te rama i te taha o taua mea"" means ""then what time is it according to the lamp's position""

now, let's look at the options:

a. haurua, 1 a - this doesn't seem to match the description, as it mentions 1 amp instead of 2 amps.

b. 2:00 am - this could be a possible answer, but we need more context to determine why the lamp's position would indicate this specific time.

c. e ai ki tēhea rama e tata ana ki te pūhiko - this option seems to be asking another question, ""is it close to which lamp and the plug?"" which doesn't directly answer your original question.

d. he iti rawa te mōhiohio hei kōrero - this option translates to ""there's not enough information to talk about,"" which might be true, but it's not a direct answer to your question either.

if you could provide more context or clarify what you mean by ""the lamp's position,"" i'd be happy to try and help you further!",true
"Ko te tōtika quantum o tētahi pūoko whakaahua ko te 0.1. Mēnā e 100 ngā whakaahua ka tukuna ki roto i te pūoko, kotahi i muri i tētahi, ka kitea e te pūoko ngā whakaahua

let's break it down:

* ko te tōtika quantum o tētahi pūoko whakaahua ko te 0.1: the quantum efficiency of a detector is 0.1.
* mēnā e 100 ngā whakaahua ka tukuna ki roto i te pūoko, kotahi i muri i tētahi: if 100 images are sent into the detector, one after another.
* ka kitea e te pūoko ngā whakaahua: the detector will see...

now, we need to find the expected value of the number of detected images.

since the quantum efficiency is 0.1, the probability of detecting each image is 0.1.

for 100 images, the expected value of the number of detected images is:

expected value = number of images × probability of detection
= 100 × 0.1

let's break it down step by step:

1. `tapeke ← numlist [1]`: the variable `tapeke` is initialized with the second element of the list `numlist` ( indexing starts at 1).
2. `mō ia uara i roto i te numlist`: this loop iterates over each element `uara` in the list `numlist`.
3. `tapeke ← tapeke + uara`: in each iteration, the current value of `tapeke` is added to the current element `uara`, and the result is stored back in `tapeke`.
4. `tapeke whakaatu`: finally, the value of `tapeke` is displayed.

now, let's test the program with the input list `[0, 1, 4, 5]`.

1. `tapeke` is initialized with the second element, which is `1`.
2. the loop iterates over each element:
	* `uara = 0`, `tapeke = 1 + 0 = 1`
	* `uara = 1`, `tapeke = 1 + 1 = 2`
	* `uara = 4`, `tapeke = 2 + 4 = 6`
	* `uara = 5`, `tapeke = 6 + 5 = 11`
3. the final value of `tapeke` is displayed: `11`

B.7.5 × 10^6 m/s
C.1.5 × 10^6 m/s
D.3.0 × 10^6 m/s",c,"a physics problem!

let's break it down step by step:

1. the proton enters a region of uniform magnetic field with a strength of 1.5 t.
2. the initial velocity of the proton is 1.5 × 10^6 m/s.
3. the proton makes an angle of 30° with the magnetic field.
4. after entering the magnetic field, the proton's velocity changes by 4 m/s.

we need to find the new velocity of the proton.

using the lorentz force equation, we can write:

f = qvb sin(θ)

where f is the force, q is the charge of the proton, v is the velocity, b is the magnetic field strength, and θ is the angle between the velocity and the magnetic field.

since the force is perpendicular to both the velocity and the magnetic field, we can use the right-hand rule to determine the direction of the force. in this case, the force will cause the proton to change its velocity by 4 m/s.

let's assume the new velocity is v'. we can set up an equation using the pythagorean theorem:

v'^2 = v^2 + (4 m/s)^2

where v' is the new velocity, and v is the initial velocity.

plugging in the values, we get:

v'^2 = (1.5 × 10^6 m/s)^2 + (4 m/s)^2
v'^2 ≈ 2.25 × 10^12 m^2/s^2 + 16 m^2/s^2
v'^2 ≈ 2.25 × 10^12 m^2/s^2
v' ≈ √(2.25 × 10^12 m^2/s^2) ≈ 1.5 × 10^6 m/s

so, the new velocity of the proton is approximately...

the issue is whether the seller's (kaihoko) defense under the ucc is valid. the seller is claiming that there was no contract because the buyer's (tangata) acceptance was conditional on the price being $35,000, and the seller did not agree to that condition.

however, the buyer had already accepted the offer on october 16, and the seller did not object to the buyer's condition until april 1, which is after the deadline for performance. by not responding to the buyer's condition within a reasonable time, the seller impliedly accepted the condition.

summary:
the passage discusses a candidate's campaign manager who realizes that many native american voters may not be able to vote for their candidate because they don't know how to write their name in english. the manager creates a public awareness campaign to educate voters on how to fill out the ballot correctly. however, five months before the election, an election official informs the campaign that the ballots with tribal affiliation markings are not valid according to government regulations. the campaign takes the issue to court, arguing that the official's interpretation of the law violates the u.s. constitution.

question:
which of the following statements, if true, would strengthen the argument that the election official's interpretation of the law is incorrect?

answer:
b. a government regulation requires that a specific space be provided on the ballot for voters to write their tribal affiliation.

* ""ko tēhea o ngā piro"" means ""which of the following""
* ""e whai ake nei e tautoko ana i te tautohe mo te taha kotahi o amerika"" means ""supports the argument for american unilateralism""
* the options are:
	+ a. hegemony (correct answer) - refers to the dominance or control of one state or group over others
	+ b. te āhuatanga o te huarahi huarahi - means ""the nature of the highway"" or ""the character of the road"", which doesn't make sense in this context
	+ c. mana o amerika - means ""the power of america"", but it's not the correct answer in this case
	+ d. ngā mea katoa o runga - means ""the things above"" or ""the upper things"", which is also not relevant to the question

so, the correct answer is a. hegemony, as it refers to the concept of one country or group exerting dominance over others, which is related to american unilateralism.",false

a. canceling the tax exemption to ensure fairness in the process.
b. canceling the tax exemption to discriminate against a particular group.
c. supporting the tax exemption within the framework of equal rights.
d. supporting the tax exemption based on the authority of the land and different aspects of human identity.

the correct answer is c. ka tautokona te mehua tāke i roto i te rohe o te tukanga tika nui.

this option supports the tax exemption within the framework of equal rights, which means that all students, regardless of gender, should be treated equally and have access to the same benefits. the current policy, which only provides a $100 exemption to female students and none to male students, is discriminatory and does not uphold the principle of equality.

options a and b are incorrect because canceling the tax exemption altogether or using it to discriminate against a particular group would not promote equality. option d is also incorrect because it implies that the tax exemption should be based on factors such as authority or human identity, rather than equal rights.",false

I muri i te whakarato i te kaihautū o te mīhini ki tētahi pūrongo rongoā katoa, ngā pire rongoā katoa, ngā pūkete rongoā, me ētahi atu tohu tūkino e hiahiatia ana, ka tonoa e te kaituku whara ngā tepe kaupapahere. Ka kitea e te kaitohutohu ka whakaputaina he take whakapono kino mehemea kaore nga tepe kaupapahere i utua ināianei tonu. Kaore te kamupene inihua i whakakāhore i te utunga, kaore he whakamāramatanga. I whakawhiwhia e te hūri te take whara e $200,000. I whiwhi te kaituku i whara i tētahi whakaritenga i hainatia mai i te mīhini mīhini e hoatu ana ki te kaituku i ngā mana tērā pea i a ia e whawhai ana te mīhini ki tana kaihoko. Tērā pea ka whakahaua e te kōti te kamupene inihua kia utua te nuinga katoa o te whakataunga hūri ki te tangata whara i raro i ēnei take?
A.Ko te tepe kaupapahere ko te $15,000, ā, ko ngā mea katoa e taea te kohikohi e te tangata whara, kāore he mahi mō te whakapono kino ki tētahi kirimana inihua.
B.I takahi te kamupene inihua i te kawenata tūturu o te whakapono pai me te mahi tika e mārama ana i ia kirimana inihua, ā, me utu te katoa o te whakawa.
C.He whaiaro te whakapono kino ki te rōpū tūturu, ā, he muhu tana mahi, ā, kaore he take a te tangata whara ki te whakahau i te kaihoko kia utu.
D.Me whakaū e te rōpū whara tana whakawa katoa ki te mīhini, ā, e kore pea e whai i te kaihautū mo taua moni.",c,"i see you're presenting a scenario in te reo māori, and i'll do my best to assist you. here's a breakdown of the situation and the possible answers:

**scenario:**

a company (kamupene inihua) sold a machine (mīhini) to a customer (kaihoko) with a warranty (tepe kaupapahere) for $15,000. the machine broke down, and the customer requested repairs. after investigating, the supplier (kaituku) found that the machine was not properly maintained and refused to cover the costs. the customer took the matter to court, and the judge ruled in favor of the customer, ordering the supplier to pay $200,000 in damages.

**question:**

will the court order the supplier to pay the majority of the damages to the injured party under these circumstances?

**answers:**

a. no, the warranty only covers $15,000, and there is no breach of contract or bad faith on the part of the supplier.

b. yes, the supplier breached the implied warranty of fitness for purpose and must pay the damages.

c. no, there is no bad faith on the part of the supplier, and they are not liable for the damages.

d. the injured party may pursue their claim against the machine's manufacturer instead of the supplier.

based on the scenario, i would recommend answer b: ""i takahi te kamupene inihua i te kawenata tūturu o te whakapono pai me te mahi tika e mārama ana i ia kirimana inihua, ā, me utu te katoa o te whakawa."" this is because the supplier failed to provide a machine that was fit for purpose, which is an implied warranty in many jurisdictions. as a result, they are liable for the damages incurred by the customer.",false
"I whiwhi nga pirihimana i tētahi aki mai i tētahi kaitiaki pono kai te mahi te tangata i te rongoā i tōna kāinga. Kātahi ka tukuna atu e nga āpiha ki te kaiwhakawā he oati tautohe e whakaatu ana i te take tūpono mo te whakaputa i tētahi whakamana rapu. Ka tukuna e te kaiwhakawā he whakamana rapu mo nga rongoā rongoā i te wāhitau o te tangata. Ka haere nga āpiha pirihimana ki te kāinga o taua tangata, a, ka tangi i te pere tatau. No te korenga o tētahi tangata e whakautu, ka pakaru nga pirihimana, a, ka tomo ki te nohoanga. I rapua e rātau nga rūma i runga i te papa tuatahi, a, kaore i kitea he whakaaturanga whakararuraru, kātahi ka haere ki waho, a, ka kite i tētahi tomokanga motuhake e ahu ana ki te papa tuarua o te nohoanga. Ka piki atu rātau ki te huarahi, a, ka tomo ki roto i te rūma moe. I roto i te rūma ka kitea e nga āpiha he rehu o te hīkaka e takoto ana i runga i te kākahu. I a rātau e haere tonu ana nga āpiha ki te rapu i te rūma moe, ka tomo te tangata whakapae ki te rūma. Ka pātai atu nga pirihimana ki te tangata whakapae mehemea ko ia te tangata. Ka kitea e te tangata whakapae a ia, a, ka kī atu ki nga pirihimana kai roto rātau i tōna rūma moe, a, ka nohoia e ia te papa tuarua o te nohoanga. Ka whakamātauria e te tangata whakapae e noho ana te tangata i runga i te papa tuatahi, a, i wehea ōna wāhi ora i te hunga whakapae. Ahakoa rā, i whakatakotoria te tangata whakapae ki raro i te hopu, a, ka whakahaua ki te pupuri i te rongoā. Kua whakaputaina e te tangata whakapae he mōtini hai aukati i te hīkaka kia kore ai e whakaaetia ki te whakaaturanga. Ko te tikanga ko te mōtini a te tangata whakapae ko
A.I tukuna, no te mea kaore te whakamana i whakaingoa i te hunga whakapae.
B.I tukuna, nā te mea kāore te whakamana i āhua i runga i te tauwhāititanga o te rohe kia rapua.
C.Ka whakakāhore, no te mea i whakapono tika nga pirihimana e rapu ana rātau i te whare o taua tangata i to rātau tomo ki nga wāhi ora o te tangata whakapae.
D.I whakakāhore, nā te mea he tika te whakamana, a, ka tukuna atu he take tūpono.",c,"it seems like you're describing a scenario where the police (pirihimana) are searching for evidence in a person's home with a warrant. they find some suspicious items, and the homeowner (tangata whakapae) tries to explain themselves. the question is about whether the search was lawful or not.

here's a breakdown of the options:

a. i tukuna, no te mea kaore te whakamana i whakaingoa i te hunga whakapae.
this option says that the search was unlawful because the warrant didn't specifically name the person being searched.

b. i tukuna, nā te mea kāore te whakamana i āhua i runga i te tauwhāititanga o te rohe kia rapua.
this option says that the search was unlawful because the warrant didn't specify the area to be searched.

c. ka whakakāhore, no te mea i whakapono tika nga pirihimana e rapu ana rātau i te whare o taua tangata i to rātau tomo ki nga wāhi ora o te tangata whakapae.
this option says that the search was lawful because the police had reasonable grounds to believe that they would find evidence in the person's home, and they followed proper procedures.

d. i whakakāhore, nā te mea he tika te whakamana, a, ka tukuna atu he take tūpono.
this option also says that the search was lawful because the warrant was valid, and it provided sufficient grounds for the search.

based on the scenario you described, i think option c or d could be correct, depending on the specific details of the case. if the police had a valid warrant and followed proper procedures, then the search might be considered lawful. however, if there were any issues with the warrant or the way it was executed, then the search might be considered unlawful.",true
